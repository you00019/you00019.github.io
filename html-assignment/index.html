            <main>
            <p>This is Jia You from Shanghai, China. Now I am studying remotely in my city for two reasons. First reason is Covid 19, second reason is Chinese New Year. Studying in my country could allow me to spend more time with my family and relatives. I have around 10 years of working experience in the marketing field.</p>
            
            <P>During the past few years, I found out that traditional marketing methods were not good enough to capture peopleâ€™s attention. Instead, more and more people are multimedia users. In order to achieve my goal which is to be a <strong>marketing professional</strong>, I chose to study Interactive Media Course at Algonquin College. </P>

            <p>I will be arriving in Canada at the end of this February, I know that it will be a big challenge for me as I need to deal with different things. I believe
